# README.md

## 1. Overview
This repository contains code for a data science project focused on analyzing game data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The primary tasks include:
- Loading and preprocessing datasets.
- Performing sentiment analysis using NLTK.
- Visualizing sentiment results and generating word clouds.
- Training predictive models (e.g., Logistic Regression) and evaluating their performance using metrics like ROC-AUC.

## 2. Files Included
- **Problem Set 2.ipynb**: Main notebook containing the full workflow for data analysis, including:
  - Data loading and preprocessing.
  - NLP-based sentiment analysis and visualization.
  - Model training and evaluation.
- **all_studies_game_data.csv**: Primary dataset used for the project (loaded via URL in the notebook).
- **round_data.csv**: Additional dataset used in the project.
