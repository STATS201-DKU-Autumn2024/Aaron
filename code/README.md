# Human Behavioral Patterns Dataset Exploration and Analysis

Welcome to the Human Behavioral Patterns Dataset Exploration and Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive examination of human and AI performance across various experiments and conditions, aiming to uncover insights into human-AI interaction, performance differences, and potential synergies in decision-making tasks.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises behavioral data from multiple experiments, capturing key features such as:

- Experiment identifiers (Paper_ID, Exp_ID, Treatment_ID)
- Performance metrics for humans, AI, and human-AI collaboration
- Number of participants and experiments
- Temporal information (Year of study)
- Statistical measures (means, standard deviations)

## Key Findings

### 1. Performance Comparison
- On average, humans outperformed AI systems in the measured tasks.
- There is significant variability in performance across experiments for both humans and AI.

### 2. Experiment Distribution
- The number of experiments per study varies widely, ranging from 5 to 1675.
- Most studies involve a moderate number of participants, with median values around 40.

### 3. Temporal Trends
- The dataset covers studies from 2020 to 2023, with a concentration in 2021-2022.

## Visualizations

### Example: Heatmap of Correlation Between Variables

Below is an example heatmap that shows the correlation between different variables in the dataset such as human performance, AI performance, and human-AI collaboration.

This heatmap helps us understand how different variables are correlated:
- Darker colors indicate stronger correlations.
- Lighter colors suggest weaker or no correlations between variables.
