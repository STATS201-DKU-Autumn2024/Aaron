##a brief description of the data source: This dataset, described in detail in Scientific Data, provides a comprehensive collection of information focused on human behavioral patterns. It captures a range of sociocultural and economic variables, covering extensive geographic regions and spanning multiple years. The data is structured to support analyses in fields like behavioral science, economics, and data-driven policy-making.
By consolidating data from diverse sources, the dataset facilitates research on trends, anomalies, and causal factors influencing behavior across populations. Standardized data cleaning and validation protocols ensure reliability and consistency, enabling robust statistical and machine-learning applications. This resource is especially valuable for comparative studies and for modeling cross-regional and longitudinal behaviors, offering a significant foundation for both foundational research and practical insights.
